========================
= todo
========================
- have "Brss" at the top
- when you add a feed, make it obvious which feeds were added (or if they were
  already there)
- make your subscriptions obvious: "Hi ___, here are your subscriptions"
- add and remove buttons should look significantly different than feed
- if you can't find any link[type='application/rss+xml'], search for
  an <a> with "rss" in its href, or rss or RSS as its content
- make rss items go in defined order. This means in updateItems, use
  .on('complete'). see
  https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser
  for more

========================
= brandon
========================
- bar at the top

========================
= endgame
========================
- minify everything into one .js with yuicompressor
- import feeds (from Google Reader export)
- grep -r "TODO" ./

========================
= done
========================
- get interfaces and such from https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped
- get basic "hello world" server running
- install tsc on openshift
- write makefiles or some sort of "compile everything" script
- feeds sorted in alphabetical order
- rounded corners
- Evan's touch library: change color while pressed
- on #edit, click anywhere on block checks/unchecks
- can't highlight
- #add textbox should hint at being a url: .com button on keyboard, etc.
- have "http://" and other stuff stripped from #add submission
- scrolling to top and bottom have native effect (blue stuff on Android)
- main.ts, not brss.ts
- in #add, clear the text box and select it
- put everything in separate files
- loading wheels everywhere. In between every transition.
- images are scaled to div width
- make div's not have their own css (should be css on a class)
- on desktop, buttons have a max width
- make "user is null" redirect to login page or something
- on add feed, don't fetch update for feed unless it's new
- on #add, if you give direct link to rss .xml, still works
- transitions
- checkboxes/input look nice
- checkbox on left
