This demonstrates jquery.appear. When you scroll down, more div's will be
generated by detecting that the bottom div appeared. To run it,

    node server.js

then access

    localhost:8000/index.html

You should be able to scroll down forever.




I actually think there's a bit of a bug in appear.jquery that will cause more
div's to be spawned than there should be. Try scrolling to the top and typing

    $("#first").is(":appeared")

 This should return false (since the first element is not visible) but I've
 found cases where it's true.
