This has a basic server that lets you log in with Facebook via Passport. To run
it, type

    node app.js

and then access

    http://localhost:8000/index.html

At that point, you should be able to log in with Facebook. When you log in and
access a page, the server will detect who you're logged in as and print out all
that information.
